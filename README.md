# Campagna project (front-end)

Campagna is the concept-idea of an e-commerce platform to promote products and tourism in a small rural community.

The app is built with Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL at the back-end, and JS React in the front- end.

This repository hosts the front-end of the project Campagna.

In order for all data to be loaded, make sure you run first the Java back-end side: https://github.com/pepcasula/CampagnaBackEnd/README.md.

Once the back-end is running, get a local copy of this repository and use the following commands to run the front-end:

```javascript
npm install
```

```javascript
npm start
```

Eventually, go to <em>localhost:3000</em> to browse the site.
