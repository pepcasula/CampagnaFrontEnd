# Campagna project (front-end)

This JavaScript React app is the front-end of the project Campagna.

In order for all back-end data to be loaded, make sure you run first the Java back-end side: https://github.com/pepcasula/CampagnaBackEnd/README.md.

Once the back-end is running, get a local copy of this repository and use the following commands to run the front-end:

```javascript
npm install
```

```javascript
npm start
```

Eventually, go to <em>localhost:3000</em> to browse the site.
